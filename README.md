# Project-6
This program accepts an input file (mp6names.txt) that contains data that consists of several lines, each 
with one person and information about them regarding their gender, and marital status, along with their 
names in an unorganized fashion. The program utilizes strings and enumerations to decide their 
standardized name and prefixes in an organized style, written to an output file (mp6output.txt).
